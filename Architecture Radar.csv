Visual Studio 2022,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Visual Studio 2022 includes more support for Azure cloud tools, as well as support for .NET 6+. Now that .NET 5.0 is no longer in LTS, Visual Studio 2019 does not support any of the active versions of .NET"
Native Azure Apps,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"Moving our APIs and Web Apps from cloud VMs into native apps on Azure could help us build and monitor them in a consistent way"
Yaml build pipelines,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Microsoft introduced the Yaml pipelines on Azure DevOps a few years ago and has been pushing it more, preferring it over the 'Classic' pipeline builder. Yaml builds do support the features of the Classic builder, while adding a lot of new features such as templates, and keep the template alongside the code it is meant to build"
Shared build templates,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,"Templates allow us to take a set of steps (such as building a .NET core solution) and repeating them in many places. If the steps need to be updated, we have only one place we need to apply the update to, and we reduce the variation between different pipelines to make it more reliable"
Health checks,Adopt,Frameworks,TRUE,"While moving to Azure Apps, Health checks allow us to quickly scan all of our API and Web apps to see that they are still running. We can also check that the response time of a health request is not much longer than expected (an early sign of a failing service), and use the health check as an easy and automated post-deployment test to find about any issues immediately"
NCrunch,Trial,Tools,TRUE,"A powerful Visual Studio extension that runs tests in real time as the code changes, and provides in-line code coverage as well as highlighting areas of inefficiency"
Three Amigos,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"A quick discussion between a developer, a tester, and a product owner or business analyst can help get everybody on the same page when starting a new piece of work, as well as highlighting any expected issues and edge cases early"
Consolidating Azure DevOps projects,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"A number of potentially powerful Project Settings such as common Pull Request policies and common Variable groups are difficult to do without a lot of repetitive manual work to consistently apply them across our entire codebase. Bringing a lot of the older projects into the same project could make things a lot easier going forwards, while still keeping them in their own repositories"
Low-code solutions,Assess,Frameworks,TRUE,"Allowing non-technical users to slice data could allow for quick and custom ways for our internal users to query large data sets, however we need to assess the data, the access privileges, and training requirements to consider this"
Classic build editor,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"The Classic editor is used for most of our build pipelines, however does not support consistent templates across builds, and Microsoft is moving away from it. New projects should aim to use Yaml pipelines instead"
Alpha versions for NuGet packages,Trial,Frameworks,TRUE,"Publishing an alpha version of a package can allow the nuget package to be tested in another project, without marking it as 'Stable'. This can be automated to only build Stable packages from a key branch such as master, while feature branches can build Alpha packages to experiment with"
Data-only Dev environments,Assess,Platforms,True,"Could we avoid having a DEV environment entirely if we only need the shared Database to support local development? What apps are difficult to maintain locally without lots of interconnected services all running?"
